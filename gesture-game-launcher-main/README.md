# 🎮 Gesture-Controlled Game Launcher

Control Android games like **Hill Climb Racing** and **Subway Surfers** using your **hand gestures** and a **webcam** — no mouse, no keyboard, just gestures!

This project uses **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and **PyAutoGUI** to trigger keypresses in games running inside **BlueStacks emulator**.
